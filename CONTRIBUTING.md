# Contributing Notes

Hi! Thanks for being interested in contributing to the ACM Website!

Throughout this document are different features that we want to achieve within our website. This project will be similar to a open-source project, where you identify something that needs work, develop it, and create a pull request, and we'll get around to reviewing it.

If you have any questions, feel free to email us at jhuacmofficers@gmail.com

## Features

### Home Page

A homepage with links to all other important aspects of the website

### Events Page

A page containing upcoming events with a register link, along with relevant information. Should be easy to update without directly editing code.

Ideally also has past events, as record keeping for the department.

### About Us

Basic contact page with officer information

### Accounts/Register/Signup

Likely the most complex part of the website (but not that complex still). Students should be able to register to become a ACM member with an email/password, this allows them to join the new mailing list (just some database) and become part of our records (records includes events attended).

Eventually, this should become a full fledged membership tracking system.

### Whatever else you think

I'm writing this document off 5 hours of sleep on a Delta Airlines flight, I've definitely missed stuff, and there's also probably a lot of stuff that none of us have thought about yet. Implement anything you think is going to be good.
